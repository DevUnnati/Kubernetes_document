Exercise 1: Role Binding
Create a Role named pod-reader that allows read-only access to Pods in the default namespace.

Create a Service Account named pod-reader-sa.

Create a Role Binding named pod-reader-binding that associates the pod-reader Role with the pod-reader-sa Service Account.

Verify that the Role Binding is correctly applied by checking the permissions of the Service Account.
