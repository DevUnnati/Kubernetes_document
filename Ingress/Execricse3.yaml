Objective:

Modify the existing Ingress resource to implement path-based routing.
Define multiple paths and ensure each path routes traffic to the correct backend service.
Instructions:

Review Existing Deployment:

Confirm that you have the following existing components from a previous exercise:
Deployment named app1-deployment with the label app: app1.
Deployment named app2-deployment with the label app: app2.
Services named app1-service and app2-service exposing the corresponding deployments.
Create an Ingress Resource for Path-Based Routing:

Open the existing Ingress resource (path-ingress.yaml).
Modify the Ingress resource to include multiple paths for path-based routing.
Define paths such as /app1 and /app2, each pointing to the corresponding backend service.
Apply the Updated Ingress Resource:

Apply the updated Ingress resource to your Kubernetes cluster.
Update Hosts File:

If needed, update your local hosts file to include the Ingress controller's IP.
Test Path-Based Routing:

Open a web browser and navigate to:
http://test.example.com/app1: Verify that you can access the app1 service.
http://test.example.com/app2: Verify that you can access the app2 service.
Experiment with additional paths defined in your Ingress resource.
Bonus: Add TLS Termination (Optional):

If you want an extra challenge, modify the Ingress resource to include TLS termination for secure communication.
