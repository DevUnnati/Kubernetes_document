Exercise: TLS Termination
Objective:

Enable TLS termination on the Ingress.
Use a self-signed certificate for simplicity.
Instructions:

Generate a Self-Signed Certificate:

Use OpenSSL or any tool of your choice to generate a self-signed SSL certificate. Save the private key and certificate in separate files.
Do not include passphrase for simplicity.
Create a Kubernetes Secret:

Create a Kubernetes Secret named tls-secret to store the generated SSL certificate and private key.
Use the kubectl create secret tls command.
Update the Ingress Resource:

Update the existing Ingress resource (basic-ingress.yaml) to include TLS configuration. Use the secret tls-secret you created.
Configure the Ingress to route traffic based on the hostname secure.example.com.
Map the path / to the sample-service with a pathType of Prefix.
Apply the Ingress with TLS:

Apply the updated Ingress resource with TLS configuration.
Update Hosts File:

If needed, update your local hosts file to include the Ingress controller's IP.
Access the Secured URL:

Open a web browser and navigate to https://secure.example.com. Since this is a self-signed certificate, you might encounter a security warning. Proceed to the site.
Note:

Remember to use http or https based on your local setup and whether you have configured TLS in your Ingress.
If you encounter any issues, refer to the official Kubernetes documentation or ask for assistance.
Performing this exercise will give you hands-on experience with enabling TLS termination on the Ingress using a self-signed certificate. Good luck!
