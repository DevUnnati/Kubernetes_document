Exercise 8: Update Backend Service
Objective:

Dynamically update the backend service for an existing Ingress resource without modifying the Ingress definition.
Verify that the Ingress controller dynamically updates its configuration.
Instructions:

Existing Ingress Resource:

Identify an existing Ingress resource in your Kubernetes cluster that routes traffic to a specific backend service.
Note the name of the Ingress resource and the current backend service it points to.
Deploy a New Backend Service:

Deploy a new sample backend service (e.g., new-backend-service).
Ensure the new backend service is accessible over the expected port (e.g., port 80).
Update the Backend Service Dynamically:

Use the appropriate command or method to dynamically update the backend service for the existing Ingress resource to point to the newly deployed backend service (new-backend-service).
Avoid modifying the Ingress definition itself.
Verify Dynamic Update:

Access the paths specified in the Ingress resource using a web browser or curl.
Verify that the Ingress controller dynamically updates its configuration to route traffic to the new backend service (new-backend-service).
Observe Behavior:

Observe the behavior of the Ingress controller in response to the dynamic update.
Confirm that the changes take effect without requiring modifications to the Ingress definition.
Clean Up (Optional):

If desired, clean up the environment by removing the dynamically deployed backend service and reverting the Ingress resource to its original configuration.
Reflect and Discuss:

Discuss the significance of dynamically updating backend services for Ingress resources.
Reflect on scenarios where dynamic updates without modifying the Ingress definition can be advantageous.
