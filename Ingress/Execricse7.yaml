Exercise 7: Ingress Annotations
Objective:

Explore various annotations supported by your Ingress controller.
Use annotations to customize the behavior of your Ingress resource, such as setting timeouts or modifying response headers.
Instructions:

Discover Supported Annotations:

Identify the Ingress controller you are using (e.g., NGINX, Traefik).
Explore the official documentation for the Ingress controller to identify the annotations it supports.
Pay attention to annotations related to timeouts, response headers, or any customization options.
Create a Sample Ingress Resource:

Write a new Ingress resource YAML file (e.g., custom-annotations-ingress.yaml).
Define a basic routing configuration with paths and backends.
Apply Custom Annotations:

Utilize the annotations discovered in step 1 to customize the behavior of your Ingress resource.
Examples of annotations to consider:
Set a timeout for backend connections.
Modify response headers.
Customize SSL/TLS settings.
Apply the Ingress Resource:

Apply the Ingress resource with the custom annotations to your Kubernetes cluster.
Validate Customizations:

Test the Ingress resource by accessing different paths.
Observe the behavior based on the applied custom annotations.
Verify that timeouts, response headers, or other customizations are applied as expected.
Experiment with Different Annotations (Optional):

If time permits, experiment with additional annotations supported by your Ingress controller.
Explore annotations related to security, rate limiting, or any other interesting features.
Reflect and Discuss:

Discuss the impact of the applied annotations on the Ingress resource behavior.
Consider scenarios where each annotation might be beneficial.
Reflect on the importance of understanding and utilizing annotations for Ingress customization.
