Objective:

Create a new Ingress resource to implement host-based routing.
Route traffic based on different hostnames to distinct backend services.
Instructions:

Review Existing Deployments:

Confirm that you have the following existing components from previous exercises:
Deployments named app1-deployment and app2-deployment with the labels app: app1 and app: app2 respectively.
Services named app1-service and app2-service exposing the corresponding deployments.
Create a New Ingress Resource for Host-Based Routing:

Create a new Ingress resource YAML file (e.g., host-ingress.yaml).
Configure the Ingress resource to route traffic based on different hostnames to distinct backend services.
Use hostnames such as app1.example.com and app2.example.com for differentiation.
Apply the New Ingress Resource:

Apply the newly created Ingress resource to your Kubernetes cluster.
Update Hosts File (if needed):

If needed, update your local hosts file to include the Ingress controller's IP and map the hostnames (app1.example.com and app2.example.com) to the respective backend services.
Test Host-Based Routing:

Open a web browser and navigate to:
http://app1.example.com: Verify that you can access the app1 service.
http://app2.example.com: Verify that you can access the app2 service.
Experiment with additional hostnames defined in your Ingress resource.
Bonus: Add TLS Termination (Optional):

If you want an extra challenge, modify the Ingress resource to include TLS termination for secure communication.
