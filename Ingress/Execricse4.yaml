Implement URL rewriting in the Ingress resource.
Change the path before it reaches the backend service.
Validate the changes to ensure the URL rewriting is functioning as intended.
Instructions:

Review Existing Setup:

Ensure you have the following existing components:
Deployments named app1-deployment and app2-deployment with the labels app: app1 and app: app2.
Services named app1-service and app2-service exposing the corresponding deployments.
An Ingress resource configured for path-based or host-based routing.
Create a New Ingress Resource for URL Rewriting:

Create a new Ingress resource YAML file (e.g., url-rewrite-ingress.yaml).
Configure the Ingress resource to perform URL rewriting before traffic reaches the backend services.
Specify the rules for URL rewriting based on your exercise requirements.
Apply the New Ingress Resource:

Apply the newly created Ingress resource to your Kubernetes cluster.
Validate URL Rewriting:

Open a web browser and navigate to the URLs specified in your Ingress resource.
Observe the changes in the path based on the URL rewriting rules.
Verify that the traffic reaches the correct backend service after URL rewriting.
Experiment with Different Paths:

Test the Ingress resource with various paths to confirm that the URL rewriting rules are consistently applied.
Validate that the changes in the path are in accordance with your specified URL rewriting rules.
Bonus: Test with Query Parameters (Optional):

If applicable to your scenario, test the Ingress resource with URLs containing query parameters.
Confirm that the URL rewriting rules handle query parameters appropriately.
