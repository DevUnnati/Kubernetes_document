Exercise 6: URL Rewriting
Objective:

Implement URL rewriting in the Ingress resource.
Change the path before it reaches the backend service.
Validate the changes to ensure the URL rewriting is functioning as intended.
Instructions:

Setup Deployments and Services:

Deploy two sample backend services, backend1 and backend2.
Expose both services through Services (backend1-service and backend2-service).
Ensure that both services are accessible over HTTP.
Create an Ingress Resource for URL Rewriting:

Write a new Ingress resource YAML file (e.g., url-rewrite-ingress.yaml).
Configure the Ingress resource to perform URL rewriting before traffic reaches the backend services.
Utilize annotations or specific Ingress rules for URL rewriting.
Apply the Ingress Resource:

Apply the newly created Ingress resource to your Kubernetes cluster.
Validate URL Rewriting:

Open a web browser and navigate to the URLs specified in your Ingress resource.
Observe the changes in the path based on the URL rewriting rules.
Verify that the traffic reaches the correct backend service after URL rewriting.
Experiment with Different Paths:

Test the Ingress resource with various paths to confirm that the URL rewriting rules are consistently applied.
Validate that the changes in the path are in accordance with your specified URL rewriting rules.
Bonus: Test with Query Parameters (Optional):

If applicable to your scenario, test the Ingress resource with URLs containing query parameters.
Confirm that the URL rewriting rules handle query parameters appropriately.
Reflect and Discuss:

Discuss the observed behavior with participants.
Consider different use cases where URL rewriting might be beneficial.
Reflect on the importance of URL rewriting in managing and optimizing web traffic.
