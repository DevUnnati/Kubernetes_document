Exercise: Pod-to-Pod Communication Control with Network Policies

Create a Namespace:

Create a Kubernetes namespace named pod-communication-control.
Deploy Pods:

Deploy several sample pods in the pod-communication-control namespace. Use labels to distinguish between different types of pods (e.g., app=frontend, app=backend, app=database).
Default Allow Policy:

Create a Network Policy in the pod-communication-control namespace that allows all pod-to-pod communication by default. This policy will serve as a baseline.
Pod-to-Pod Communication Control Policies:

Create Network Policies to control pod-to-pod communication:
Allow communication only between pods labeled as app=frontend and app=backend.
Allow communication only from pods labeled as app=backend to pods labeled as app=database.
Deny communication from pods labeled as app=frontend to pods labeled as app=database.
Verification:

Deploy test pods with the appropriate labels in the pod-communication-control namespace.
Test and verify that only allowed traffic, as defined by the Network Policies, is permitted. For example:
Verify that pods labeled as app=frontend can communicate with pods labeled as app=backend.
Verify that pods labeled as app=backend can communicate with pods labeled as app=database.
Verify that pods labeled as app=frontend cannot communicate with pods labeled as app=database.
Additional Policies:

Experiment with additional policies to control pod-to-pod communication based on your preferences. For example:
Allow communication between pods in the same namespace but deny communication across namespaces.
Cleanup:

Delete the pod-communication-control namespace and associated resources.
