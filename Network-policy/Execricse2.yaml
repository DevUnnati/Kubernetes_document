Exercise: Allow Communication Between Pods in Different Namespaces
Setup:

Create two namespaces: frontend-ns and backend-ns.
Deploy a pod named frontend-pod in the frontend-ns namespace with the label app=frontend.
Deploy a pod named backend-pod in the backend-ns namespace with the label app=backend.
Default Deny:

Create a default deny Network Policy in both namespaces to block all incoming traffic.
Allow Communication:

Create a Network Policy in the frontend-ns namespace.
Allow outgoing traffic from frontend-pod to pods labeled app=backend in the backend-ns namespace.
Verification:

Deploy a test pod in the backend-ns namespace labeled app=test.
Attempt to access the frontend-pod from the test pod.
Validation:

Validate that the communication is successful only between backend-pod and frontend-pod and is denied from the test pod.
Cleanup:

Delete the Network Policies and pods created during the exercise.
