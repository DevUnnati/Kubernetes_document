Create a Namespace:

Create a Kubernetes namespace named secure-communication.
Deploy Applications:

Deploy three sample applications in the secure-communication namespace. Use labels to distinguish between the applications (e.g., app=app-1, app=app-2, app=app-3).
Default Deny Policy:

Create a Network Policy in the secure-communication namespace that enforces a default deny for all pods. This policy should block all ingress and egress traffic.
Specific Allow Policy:

Create Network Policies to allow communication only for specific pods or namespaces. For example:
Allow communication between pods labeled as app=app-1 and app=app-2.
Allow communication from the app=app-3 pod to any pod in the default namespace.
Verification:

Deploy test pods labeled with the appropriate labels in the secure-communication namespace.
Verify that communication is allowed only as specified in the specific allow policies and is denied otherwise.
Cleanup:

Delete the secure-communication namespace and associated resources.
