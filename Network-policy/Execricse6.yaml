Create Two Namespaces:

Create two Kubernetes namespaces named namespace-1 and namespace-2.
Deploy Applications:

Deploy a sample application in each namespace. You can use Nginx as an example.
Network Policy for Namespace-1:

Create a Network Policy in namespace-1 that allows egress traffic only to a specific external IP address (e.g., 203.0.113.1).
Network Policy for Namespace-2:

Create a Network Policy in namespace-2 that allows egress traffic only to a specific external domain (e.g., example.com).
Deployment Verification:

Deploy a test pod in each namespace.
Try to make an HTTP request from the pod in namespace-1 to the specific external IP address (203.0.113.1). Verify that the communication is allowed.
Attempt to make an HTTP request from the pod in namespace-1 to an external domain (e.g., example.com). Verify that the communication is blocked.
Similarly, try to make an HTTP request from the pod in namespace-2 to the specific external IP address (203.0.113.1). Verify that the communication is blocked.
Attempt to make an HTTP request from the pod in namespace-2 to the external domain (example.com). Verify that the communication is allowed.
Cleanup:

Delete the namespaces and associated resources created during the exercise.
