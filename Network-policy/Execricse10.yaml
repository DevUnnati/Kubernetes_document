Create a Namespace:

Create a Kubernetes namespace named logging-monitoring.
Deploy Pods:

Deploy two sample pods in the logging-monitoring namespace (e.g., Nginx pods). Use labels to distinguish between the pods.
Network Policy with Logging:

Create a Network Policy in the logging-monitoring namespace that includes logging for ingress and egress traffic.
Allow incoming traffic only to pods labeled as app=backend.
Allow outgoing traffic only from pods labeled as app=frontend.
Enable logging for both ingress and egress rules.
Verification:

Deploy a test pod in the logging-monitoring namespace.
Generate network traffic that matches the Network Policy rules.
Verify that logs are generated and capture the expected network traffic based on the Network Policy rules.
Monitoring and Analysis:

Use monitoring tools (e.g., kubectl logs, or your preferred log aggregation system) to analyze the logs and confirm that the Network Policy rules are being logged correctly.
Adjust Policies:

Modify the Network Policy to include additional rules or adjust existing rules.
Generate traffic that matches the modified rules and observe the corresponding logs.
Cleanup:

Delete the logging-monitoring namespace and associated resources.
