Create a Namespace:

Create a Kubernetes namespace named label-policies.
Deploy Labeled Pods:

Deploy three pods in the label-policies namespace, each with different labels (e.g., app=frontend, app=backend, app=database).
Label-Based Allow Policy:

Create a Network Policy that allows communication only between pods labeled as app=frontend and app=backend.
Label-Based Deny Policy:

Create a Network Policy that denies communication between pods labeled as app=frontend and app=database.
Verification:

Deploy a test pod in the label-policies namespace without any specific labels.
Verify that the test pod can communicate with the app=frontend pod.
Verify that the test pod is denied communication with the app=backend and app=database pods based on the label-based policies.
Additional Policies:

Create additional label-based policies to allow or deny communication based on your preference. For example, create a policy that allows communication only between pods labeled as tier=frontend and tier=backend.
Cleanup:

Delete the label-policies namespace and associated resources.
