Create a Namespace:

Create a Kubernetes namespace named label-policies.
Deploy Labeled Pods:

Deploy three pods in the label-policies namespace, each with different labels (e.g., app=frontend, app=backend, app=database).
Label-Based Allow Policy:

Create a Network Policy that allows communication only between pods labeled as app=frontend and app=backend.
Label-Based Deny Policy:

Create a Network Policy that denies communication between pods labeled as app=frontend and app=database.
Verification:

Deploy a test pod in the label-policies namespace without any specific labels.
Verify that the test pod can communicate with the app=frontend pod.
Verify that the test pod is denied communication with the app=backend and app=database pods based on the label-based policies.
Additional Policies:

Create additional label-based policies to allow or deny communication based on your preference. For example, create a policy that allows communication only between pods labeled as tier=frontend and tier=backend.
Cleanup:

Delete the label-policies namespace and associated resources.

Solution:

Commands:
a) for Creating ns:
   kubectl create ns labels-policies

b) for creating pods:
   kubectl run nginx1 --image=nginx -n labels-policies --label=app=frontend
   kubectl run nginx2 --image=nginx -n labels-policies --label=app=backend
   kubectl run nginx3 --image=nginx -n labels-policies --label=app=database

c) for exposing services:
   kubectl expose service nginx1 --port=8080 --target-port=80 -n label-policies
   kubectl expose service nginx2 --port=8080 --target-port=80 -n label-policies
   kubectl expose service nginx3 --port=8080 --target-port=80 -n label-policies
   

for performing this activity
a) Backend pod - Ingress - frontend
b) Database pod - Ingress -Backend
c) frontend pod - Ingress - Database

a) Create a Network Policy that allows communication only between pods labeled as app=frontend and app=backend.

b) Verify that the test pod can communicate with the app=frontend pod:
Verify that the test pod is denied communication with the app=backend and app=database pods based on the label-based policies:
kubectl exec -it test -n label-policies bash -- curl http://<service-ip> or <service-name>:<port-number>
